- max_value is currently misused
  - start_value: where does the schedule start
  - end_value: where does the schedule end
  - min_value: result is never smaller than this
  - max_value: result is never larger than this

- percentage sequential schedule is buggy where from wupcos on the first value of the cosine schedule is omitted
  - instead the last value of the linear schedule is copied
- abs_step is never propagated in sequential schedules
- test epoch/update/sample based validation in factory
- when step/percentage schedules are mixed -> convert percentage to step schedules
